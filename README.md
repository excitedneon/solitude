Solitude
========
A VR world painting experience inspired by the short film Shelter. You are given a brush, a palette, and a canvas. Now paint your own world.

### Controls
* Trigger: toggle grabbing things (eg. hover your hand over the brush and click the trigger, it will pick it up until you next time click the trigger)  
* Escape to exit the game.  
* Otherwise it's just, touch the palette's colors with the brush and paint! The black paint is for erasing things.
